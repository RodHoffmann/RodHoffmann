ðŸš€ From MBA to Coder ðŸš€

With over 7 years of experience in business across various industries, I made a bold pivot 2 years ago to pursue my true passion: coding. After completing a web development BootCamp, I now teach at the same BootCamp, sharing my knowledge and igniting the same curiosity in others.

I'm a lifelong learner, constantly staying updated with the latest technologies. Having excelled in the 42 Berlin piscine, I'm now deep into the core curriculum, learning low-level code to understand how everything works "under the hood," while balancing work and personal projects.

Let's connect and collaborate! I'm always excited to meet fellow enthusiasts passionate about programming.
